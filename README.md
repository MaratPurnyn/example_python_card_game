# Example Python 3.5 Card Game

It's a simple game, but I only import random and os on purpose.

In this game there are n-players (most likely 4, but it doesnt matter)
The deck has the standard 52 cards + 4 penalty cards

Each round each player draws a card

At the end of the round,
Whoever's card has the higherst rank wins and get 2 points.
Whoever drew a penalty card gets -1 point.
The scoreboard is printed

The game ends when someone gets to 21 with a 2 point lead.
